\section{Overview and Motivation}

\subsection{Impact and Importance}
Facial expressions form an integral part of the human communication system. The applications of automatic facial analysis have been employed across various domains including biology, psychology, neuroscience, sociology, computer animation, computer science\cite{survey1}, human-computer interaction\cite{appHCI1} and human-robot interaction\cite{appHRI2}. Automatic emotion or facial expression analysis has been evolving each year to offer a significant value for advancing social robotics, human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence in general\cite{affectiva}.

Historically, facial expressions were being studied since the beginning of the 20th century\cite{book1}. Among many approaches that can be taken to analyze and interpret facial expressions, the detection of Facial Action Units AUs as per the Facial Action Coding System FACS given by Ekman77\cite{facs} is the most popular and widely accepted one. Ekman's work in developing a scientific model to train people to understand and analyze the facial expressions gained enormous traction. Highly meticulous organizations such as FBI started training people based on the approaches developed by Ekman to detect deception in their investigations\cite{ekmanwebsite}. Ekman collaborated with Terry Sejnowski in 1996 to show that the process of automatic facial expression identification was promising\cite{first_auto_facs}. There has been many popular research groups including MIT's Affective Computing Group\cite{mitlab} directed by Rosalind W Picard, University of Pittsburgh's The Affectiva Analysis Group \cite{upitlab} directed by Cohn were phenomenal in advancing automatic facial expression Recognition (auto-FER) and analysis\cite{survey2}. Social Signal Processing Network\cite{sspnet} is an European institute which propelled the involvement and advancement of the state of the arts in the auto-FER. All of them provided large public data-sets and conducted international annual challenges in automatic facial expression analysis for the past decade. The community journeyed past the classic computer vision and machine learning techniques of handcrafting features and models to leveraging the modern deep learning techniques with advancement of computational capabilities of computers while tackling this problem. 

While we may have surpassed the general human accuracy in making the computers label the facial expression given a frontal face image of low resolution\cite{SArt}, we are way behind in substituting trained humans or general humans given higher resolution pictures of frontal faces\cite{survey1,book1,ekmanwebsite}. Thus automatic facial expression recognition is an interesting and challenging problem. There are a number of open challenges researchers face when dealing with  which are discussed below.

\subsection{Challenges and Potential Solutions}
\begin{itemize}

\item The mainstream contemporary automatic facial expression recognition research, despite all the ties to psychology and cognitive science, is still being directed towards modelling and tackling the auto-FER as a general image classification problem.\cite{survey1}. Thus, researchers invited all the general challenges of an image classification problem such as lack of sufficient data, occlusion, rotation, scaling, lighting. One could leverage the wisdom from human perception of emotions and facial expressions to overcome the lack of enough data to some extent.

\item A bulk of the very recent deep learning research\cite{SArt} is focused on the assumption that the facial expression is spontaneous and thus modeled the auto-FER as an image classification task which classifies only the peak facial activity, ignoring the temporal dependency in classification. One could model the problem as a sequence classification problem and address the temporal dependency.

\item Feature selection becomes even more interesting even though we are in the era of deep learning for auto-FER when modeled as a sequence classification problem. The reason is that the naive recurrent neural networks are very hard to train to learn the appropriate features for facial expression recognition, especially with less labeled data. One could leverage the use of convolutional neural networks\cite{SArt} to learn low level features before learning higher level features for sequence classification.
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction to Automatic Facial Expression Classification}


\subsection{Emotions and Facial Expressions}
While there were many debates surrounding the topics of emotions and facial expressions, the most popularly accepted convention is the evolutionist approach which emphasizes that all humans despite their cultural, regional, socio-economic, racial, gender, and other backgrounds, evolved to display certain facial expressions to convey seven basic emotions. As per many findings\cite{book1, ekmanwebsite, emfacsWiki}, these expressions are considered universal even to primates and uncivilized people. Figure \ref{fig:emotions1} shows an example of different facial expressions regarded as universal emotions.

  \caption{The seven universal facial expressions portraying different emotions\cite{fig1}}
  \label{fig:emotions1}
\end{figure}


 Traditionally humans are trained to recognize the movements of human facial muscles and code the AUs and then the AU sequences are then interpreted as seven universal emotions or facial expressions which are given by Ekman in his Emotion Facial Action Coding System EMFACS\cite{emfacs}. The intensities of the existence of the AUs may vary while the portrayal of an expression with time. This posed many challenges such as scalability and efficiency. This approach also restricted the applications to the laboratories.\cite{survey3}. Figure \ref{fig:emotions2} and table \ref{table:emotions1} show different standard examples of emotion/facial expression dictionaries for presence of different action units.

\section{Related Work}


\subsection{Traditional Approaches}


Later, as we have seen the growth of computer vision, many people attempted to solve this problem by, starting out naturally with, addressing the issue of automatic AU recognition\cite{survey3}. While in the era of hand-crafted features for image analysis, Gabor wavelet features worked better than most other features\cite{autofacs1}, \cite{autofacs2}.


While some may claim we may have surpassed human accuracy\cite{SArt} in making computers recognize human emotions through facial expressions, the general facial expression recognition accuracy in wild settings has been stagnated at about 75 percent.
