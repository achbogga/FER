To all the people who inspired me in pursuing challenges\\\vspace{12pt}
`` There are certain emotions that will kill your drive; frustration and confusion. You can change these to a positive force. Frustration means you are on the verge of a breakthrough. Confusion can mean you are about to learn something. Expect the breakthrough and expect to learn. '' â€”-- Kathleen Spike
